                    I am a dreamer to be a programmer in Seattle. 
                    As a Interior designer, a Metal artwork designer, a servant of government I experienced a few areas in my life, 
                    and now I am excited to get dive into Coding Boot Camp as a new career.
                    What I am fascinated in programming is that it never lies nor exaggerates. 
                    It just reveals what I did. I love the the clear and genuine part the most. 
                    Alongside, this could get me to be harmonious with people around me through a language it's own. 
                    I cant' wait to work and live with other programmers.
                </p>                
               <!--  <p>
                    I am a part of green nature, living in a city. I am so used to live in a well organized city Seoul, but I so much in love hiking mountains, which has full of attracts in four seasons. This could be my fortress when I get tired of living and working. Someone has dogs and cats, and I have green nature.
                </p> -->
                <br>
                <h5>Let me share my story a bit here </h5>
                <p>
                    At the first interior design company that I worked for in 2000 right after I graduated in Korea, I wasn't getting paid that much, around $600/mo, 
                    that was just for commuting. Thinking back on it, that was kind of an intern treatment. My boss took me on as an apprentice to train, 
                    more like she had to teach me than thought of me as an employee. My boss was a single lady,  so to get a project, we had to do competitions all the time. 
                    Every day had a deadline. I couldnâ€™t go home everyday. Instead, I went home once in two days, so I had to sleep in the office on the chairs put together, to meet the deadline. 
                    Usually, once the chief designer started to correct the plan, there were at least 15-20 pieces of drawings such as elevations, sections that should be corrected, followed by the presentation boards.
      
                    Through that hard time, now I can recall that I learned the most. More than that, we were 6 women working together at that time, 
                    we could become friends so quickly through the hard time. I quit that job not long after though. I wanted to sleep properly. 
                </p>
                <p>              
                    The second company was Design Studio. We worked for Hyundai Development, mainly building model houses which had several types of apartments. 
                    I worked at the planning department, the drawing part. I found every office had its own way of composing the drawings. 
                    It was very different from what I learned before, and the whole amount of drawing was way more. 
                    Only one apartment design included several drawings of each rooms, such as the main room, second room, third room, living room, kitchen, bathroom, balcony,  foyer, etc. 
                  
                    The working environment and wages was a bit better and one significantly good thing about it was that I should go out and check whether my plan is going well or not. 
                    The constructor in the site often needed the designer there to check that we were on the same page. 
                    I could learn a lot at the real site, looking at the process of building. 
                  
                    However, the culture in that industry was full of Korean gatherings, so I had to drink more often with them to keep a good relationship. 
                    It gradually became harmful to my health condition and I needed to stay away from interior design. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, I began wanting to have an average wage compared to others. So I got into an NGO bank dealing with micro credit, lending small amounts of money to people to help them survive independently. 
                    It was controlled under the Korean government. I worked there for 7.5 years at a department of general affairs and managing volunteers. 
                  
                    What I did was generally meeting the demands of employees. My co-workers were my customers. I managed all the stuff in the company from pencils to interior design. 
                  
                    I collected workers demands every month and put in an order to supplement the company and got them paid. 
                    Also, when our boss ordered to make a new office to extend the business, I could meet the deadline. I made a schedule of all kinds of workers that were to come and called them in, set them to work in a certain period. From the ceiling to wall to floor and electricity, and last of all was the furniture. One time, I got an order to circulate all the traditional Korean markets and to get the data of how they were using the money we lent. It took me 3 months to visit all of them and make a report with photos and Exels. Lastly, I managed young volunteers who wanted to know and have experiences with what the Government NGO bank was doing. I advertised to the whole area in Korea through the internet, when and how long this period was going to last to collect volunteers and have interviews with them, select them, deploy them to a nearby Smile MicroCredit Bank offices. At the end of the period, they reported their activities with short videos including visiting the local traditional market and a talent donation to one of the stores, so that they knew what Microcredit was. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason I am here in Seattle, US is actually because of my Mom who is the most adventurous and courageous woman I have ever seen in my life.
                    I studied, worked in Korea and just satisfied with my environment and never dreamed of going abroad and stand up by myself.
                    One day, I started to worry about my life in my old age and focus on making money only. She noticed that my life is going to where being miserable.
                    She knew that I am not going to look around nor do anything else, other than accumulating properties and money, which will definitely screw up my life eventually.
                    She persuaded me to look for something else out there you want do and encouraged me to move forward. 
                    I know nothing about this huge country and I am in this very entry level. 
                    But the fact that I am here, and learning a complete new subject make me to dream my future. I could call this is happy.
                </p>
